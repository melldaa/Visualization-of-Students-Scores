## Exploratory Data Analysis of Studentsâ€™ Academic Performance
This project analyzes a dataset containing studentsâ€™ scores in Math, Reading, and Writing, along with demographic and socioeconomic attributes such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course completion.
The aim is to explore trends, relationships, and patterns that may influence academic performance.

## ðŸ“Š Key Analysis & Visualizations
The analysis includes:
- Score distributions by gender, ethnicity, and other demographics
- Correlation analysis between Math, Reading, and Writing scores
- Impact of lunch type and test preparation course on performance
- Boxplots, scatterplots, hexbin plots, density contours, and other visualization methods
- Stacked bar charts for categorical comparisons
- Pairwise relationships with correlation coefficients

 ## ðŸ“ˆ Example Insights
- Students who completed a test preparation course generally scored higher.
- There is a strong positive correlation between Math, Reading, and Writing scores.
- Socioeconomic indicators (e.g., lunch type, parental education) show clear performance gaps.
